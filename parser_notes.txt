Parsing: Parsing is the process of analyzing the stream of 
tokens according to the rules of the language's grammar. 
This involves recognizing the relationships between tokens 
and grouping them into higher-level constructs such as expressions, 
statements, function declarations, etc. 
The output of this stage is the AST.

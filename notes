The Hindley-Milner type system is a powerful type inference algorithm used in programming languages like Haskell. Here's a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
function infer_type(expression, environment):
    if expression is a variable x:
        if x is in the environment:
            return environment[x]
        else:
            raise Error("Variable x not found in environment")

    if expression is a function abstraction (λx. e):
        new_type_variable = fresh_type_variable()
        extended_environment = environment with x mapped to new_type_variable
        inferred_type_of_e = infer_type(e, extended_environment)
        return FunctionType(new_type_variable, inferred_type_of_e)

    if expression is a function application (e1 e2):
        inferred_type_of_e1 = infer_type(e1, environment)
        inferred_type_of_e2 = infer_type(e2, environment)
        new_type_variable = fresh_type_variable()
        unify(inferred_type_of_e1, FunctionType(inferred_type_of_e2, new_type_variable))
        return new_type_variable

    if expression is a let-binding (let x = e1 in e2):
        inferred_type_of_e1 = infer_type(e1, environment)
        extended_environment = environment with x mapped to inferred_type_of_e1
        return infer_type(e2, extended_environment)

    if expression is a constant (such as an integer, string, etc.):
        return type_of_constant(expression)

    # Add more cases for other language constructs as needed

function unify(type1, type2):
    if type1 is equal to type2:
        return
    if type1 is a type variable:
        if occurs_check(type1, type2):
            raise Error("Occurs check fails")
        update_type_variable(type1, type2)
    if type2 is a type variable:
        unify(type2, type1)
    if type1 is a function type and type2 is a function type:
        unify(type1.input_type, type2.input_type)
        unify(type1.output_type, type2.output_type)
    else:
        raise Error("Type mismatch")

function occurs_check(type_variable, type):
    # Check if type_variable occurs in type
    return type_variable appears in the type

function fresh_type_variable():
    # Generate a fresh type variable
    return a new type variable

function type_of_constant(constant):
    # Determine the type of constant (e.g., int, string, etc.)
    return type_of_constant

# Example usage:
expression = parse("λx. x + 1")
environment = {}
inferred_type = infer_type(expression, environment)
print("Inferred type:", inferred_type)
```

This pseudocode outlines the general structure of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm, including type inference, unification, type variable generation, and handling different language constructs like variables, function abstractions, function applications, let-bindings, and constants. Note that you may need to adjust or expand this pseudocode based on the specific requirements and features of your programming language.

To infer the type of the expression `λx. x + 1`, let's follow the steps outlined in the pseudocode:

1. The expression is a function abstraction (λx. e), where `x` is the parameter and `e` is the body of the function.
2. We assign a fresh type variable to `x` and extend the environment with this mapping.
3. We recursively infer the type of the body expression `x + 1`.
4. In the body expression, `x` is a variable, so we look up its type in the environment. Since it's not there, we assign a new type variable to it.
5. `1` is a constant, so we determine its type (e.g., integer).
6. `+` is a function that takes two arguments of the same type and returns a value of that type. Let's say it's a function of type `int -> int -> int`.
7. We unify the type of `x` with the type of `1` (let's say it's `int`).
8. The resulting type of the function body is `int`.
9. Finally, the resulting type of the entire expression is `int -> int`.

So, the inferred type of the expression `λx. x + 1` is `int -> int`.
